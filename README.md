# Stock-Price-Prediction
-This project uses keras and LSTM neural networks to train on existing data about stocks (TESLA, GOOGLE, TATA and others) and then predcit the future prices by using the trained model.                                                                                                                                                                               
-model trainer.py is used to train our model based on LSTM on the existing data and save the trained model and its weights.                                            
-predictor.py is used to predict future prices using our pre-trained model.                                                                                                           
-Just be careful to use same stock data for training the model and predicting the prices (testing).
